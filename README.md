# Feedback for axo Releases

[**Report a 🐛 bug**][bugreport]

[**Request a ➕ feature**][featurerequest]

Thanks so much for signing up for our private beta! If you aren't on the waitlist you can join [here](https://dash.axo.dev).

This is our first released service, and we are so excited to hear what you think. Here's a few links to help get you started:

### 💁 Sign up and create a user
You can sign up [here](https://dash.axo.dev/onboarding?plan=free&step=1). This will sign you up for our free plan. If you are interested in exploring more functionality you can switch to the "paid" plan- you'll need to enter credit card details, but we won't charge you while the product is in beta. If you have any worries or questions about this, reach out!

### 📖 Read the docs
Using axo Releases is as easy as adding a single line to your cargo-dist configuration ([docs here!](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html)). If you aren't familiar with cargo-dist, you can get started [here](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/). If you are looking for an example project to play with you can always fork our [axolotlsay](https://github.com/axodotdev/axolotlsay) project.

### 💬 Give us all the feedback
We've set up a bunch of spots for you to get help and give us all the feedback:
- **[😎 Discord](https://discord.gg/4NWGb6QdaX):** This is the best place to get instant feedback on any question. We have a specific channel for the releases-beta!
- **🏗️ Product repo (you are here!):** This is a great place to request features, report bugs, and learn about what we have in the product pipeline.
- **[📆 One-on-one chat](https://calendly.com/axodotdev/60-minute-meeting?back=1&month=2024-01):** Schedule some time with a team member to talk/walk through your feedback in a voice or video chat.
- **✉️ Email:** You can always send us a message at hello@axo.dev.

Happy shipping! 🚀🚀🚀
